# DataMining-LA2

# Crop Recommendation Prediction
The recommendation of Crop according to specific seasons

# Brief Description of the project
We are aiming to predict the appropriate crop for a given season using supervised machine learning model. We use parameters like ratio of Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium, Ph values of the soil, relative humidity in %, etc. We are using Data Mining classifier algorithms that require extensive data,
